\# simple-llm-exporter a tool to export entire scripts to a text file with a file tree and description, for exporting to llm's # python export.py --export-options 2,1,1,all --recent 90 # python export.py --export-options 0,1,0 --map-functions Overview The export.py script allows users to export selected files from a Flask project based on certain criteria like file types, modification time, and structure mapping. It can also map Python and JavaScript functions, classes, and methods for easier navigation. The output is stored in a text file, organized into sections like a project description, file tree, and content from specific file types. Requirements Python 3.6+ Flask project with directories such as app and static Command Line Usage The script supports several command line arguments to control what gets exported: Basic Usage Export with default options: bash python export.py This will: Export the project description Include the file tree Export all file types (.py, .js, .md, .html, .css, .json, .txt, and other files) Output is stored in ./backups/exported\_files\_.txt. Export Options The --export-options flag allows you to control what gets exported. Syntax: bash --export-options ,,, Each value is either 0 (disable) or 1 (enable). For example: 1,1,1,all: Export description, file tree, and all file types. 0,1,0: Skip description, export tree, and no file content. Example 1: Export specific file types Export project structure and only Python and JSON files: bash python export.py --export-options 0,1,0,py,json Example 2: Full export with all file types bash python export.py --export-options 1,1,1,all This exports: Project description File tree All file types Filtering by Recent Files The --recent flag restricts the export to files modified in the last N minutes. Example: Export files modified in the last 90 minutes bash python export.py --recent 90 Mapping Functions, Classes, and Methods The --map-functions flag maps Python and JavaScript functions, classes, and methods in the export. Example: Export with function and method mapping bash python export.py --map-functions This will include a hierarchical view of functions, classes, and methods in Python and JavaScript files in the exported tree. Output The exported output file will include: Project Description (if enabled) File Tree (if enabled) File Content (if enabled), with sections for each file type or all files based on your options. Logs The script will attempt to include the most recent log file from the logs/ directory if it exists. The log file must follow the naming pattern log\_.txt. Example Commands Export the entire project tree with a description and all file types: bash python export.py --export-options 1,1,1,all Export only Python and Markdown files from the last 60 minutes with function mapping: bash python export.py --export-options 0,1,0,py,md --recent 60 --map-functions Export project description and structure without file content: bash python export.py --export-options 1,1,0 Conclusion Use this script to easily export and map project files based on your needs. Customize the export options to filter by file type, time of last modification, or include a structured view of functions and methods in Python and JavaScript files.
